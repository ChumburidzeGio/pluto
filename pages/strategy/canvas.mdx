# Lean Canvas

### Problem
It is vital to define and understand the problem you are trying to solve before applying effort and resources to the development of a product or idea. What are the top problems our potential customers face? What are the existing alternatives that solve those problems (competitors)?

### Solution
Solutions provide answers to the identified problem. How do we, or can we solve the problem. What is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that will address the problems?

### Key Metrics
Key Metrics measure how well you are progressing towards your goals. It is crucial that you identify the right metrics. What is the single most important measure that drives what we do? How will we know we are succeeding?

### Unique Value Proposition
Your Unique Value Proposition (UVP) reflects how your solution solves the customer’s problems. What is unique about what we provide? Why would a customer choose our solution over other alternatives?

### Unfair Advantage
An unfair advantage is your competitive advantage and barrier to entry.
What do we do or have that deters copy cats and competitors and which can’t be bought?

### Channels
Channels are the way in which you reach your individual customer segments.
How do/should we, sell, deliver, and maintain our products and services. Which channels work best for each of our customer segments? Which channels are the most cost effective?

### Customer Segments
Customer segments are groups of people you create value for by solving their problems. Who are our most important current and potential customers? What do they need or want? How do they think and feel? What do they do?

### Cost Structure
Cost structure identifies expenses which are essential for your business model to work.
What are the primary cost drivers for our business and how do they relate to revenue and delivery of our Unique Value Proposition? Are costs fixed or variable? How will costs scale as we grow?

### Revenue Streams
Revenue streams are the ways in which your business earns money.
What products and services are customers willing to pay for? How do they prefer to pay? How much does each revenue stream contribute to the overall total?
