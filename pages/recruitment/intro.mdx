### How to use it
There is no particular order to filling in this model, but this process could help to make it clear and straightforward

- Start with determining your purpose and who this model created for.
- Define your Candidate Persona by grouping them into clusters based on their common characteristics (age, race, gender, etc). Then describe what candidates are looking for in their future company in the Employee Value Proposition box.
- Now that you have a clear picture of who you’re serving and how you’ll delight them, continue with the Channels and Candidate Relationships boxes to design how you will acquire them and how you will interact with them.
- Describe how the recruitment will work “behind the scenes” with Partners & Stakeholders, Key Activities, and Resources & Technology. Try to list all vital materials, important processes and invaluable allies.
- The bottom line of the canvas represents the bottom line of your recruitment: what's in and what's out.
- The last step is linking the boxes and tidying up. You are now ready to roll out a more robust recruitment process - go for it!
