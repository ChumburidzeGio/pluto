# What is Economics?
People have to make choices because of scarcity, the fact that they donâ€™t have enough resources to satisfy all their wants. Economics studies how people allocate resources among alternative uses. Macroeconomics studies national economies, and microeconomics studies the behavior of individual people and individual firms. Economists assume that people work toward maximizing their utility, or happiness, and firms act to maximize profits.
