### Chat Box

Easiest way to talk with prospects is the chat box which usually pops up on the right bottom corner. One option is using [Collect.Chat](https://collect.chat/) where you can sign up for free and setup some conversation template for your prospects. Alternatives are Intercom, Drift, Crisp Chat, Facebook Customer Chat, Jumper.ai and plenty of other which you can google on your own.[https://chatra.io/](https://chatra.io/)
