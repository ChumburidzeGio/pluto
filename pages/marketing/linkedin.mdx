### Content

Post documents on LinkedIn because when users swipe to get to the next page LinkedIn counts it as an engagement, same way as on long posts "See More", and it gives extra boost to the post.

### LinkedIn Ads

LinkedIn ads, if you don't have lifetime value of at least 15k per user, it's not worth it. But if you run it, watch [AJ Wilcox](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilcoxaj/) courses on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advertising-on-linkedin-2) or on [CXL](https://cxl.com/institute/online-course/linkedin-advertising/).
