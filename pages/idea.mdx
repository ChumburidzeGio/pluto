# Startup ideas
Startups are not an art, and they should not be appreciated by one or two people or just by the creator itself; it's the business, so it should be something that people will want to pay for.

“… there’s only two ways I know of to make money-bundling and unbundling” — [James Barksdale](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling)

# Idea Validation
First thing after you came up with great idea is validating it.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    NEVER EVER START WORKING ON SOME IDEA WITHOUT PROPERLY VALIDATING IT !!!
</Callout>

For validating idea we need to create some nice landing page and direct people there. As a pre-request is coming up with the name for the product.

Before you start anything just make competitor research and just google similar services. Please do it carefully, because very frequently you build things that already exists and find out mid-way to MVP which sucks! Sit and google carefully for ideas like yours and make sure that you are not building something that already exists and functions well. Sometimes it might seem that you are the only one but search more, there is huge chance that you are not building something unique. Also, frequently first-time founder make mistakes like: Ohh they have terrible website we will make much nicer one, ohh our system will be more user-friendly - it never works because that website can always make redesign and kill your startup just by spending several thousand baks on redesign. Make sure that what you do is unique and delivers real value to customer.

After you made sure that what you build is unique, let's start validating idea by creating landing page and sending some traffic to website and talking with prespects.

# First customers
As a first customer you should not look for just hardest to gain customers for the proof that your product works, or for just any customer but for ones who are the most desperate, who has the most of the problem, who will want to use your crappy MVP just because they have too much pain from the problem you solve.
